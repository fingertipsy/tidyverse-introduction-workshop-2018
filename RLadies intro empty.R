# Welcome to the first R-Ladies meetup and our introduction to R!
# In this code, we will look at the basics of R.
# We will start by creating our own objects and then move on to playing with the survey data.
# We finish by using a package.

# Part 1, creating objects

# Assign to object x the value 5

# Assign object x to be a vector of length 5 with elements 1,2,3,4,5

# Create new vectors y, z, u and v from x

# Extract common summary statistics from x

# Create objects from particular elements of x

# Check what type of vector x is

# Create a 3x3 matrix M with values 1:9

# Look at different elements of M

# Create a vector m1 from a column of matrix M

# Create a 3x3 matrix N with values 1:9, arranged differently

# Create matrices O and P from M and N

# Transpose M

# Use a for loop to make a new matrix that depends on element index of M

# Use a for loop but now include a condition

# Q: Create 3x3 matrix with values 3 to 15, increasing by 3 each time.
# Try multiplying/dividing/adding/substracting this matrix with matrix M.
# What is the maximum value in your new matrix?

# Part 2, survey data

# Import survey data

# Change the names of the columns (variables)

# Create a vector from one of the columns of the dataframe

# Create a vector with values 1:number of rows in the survey data

# Join the uniqueID vector to the left of the survey data

# Check how many responders wanted 1.5h sessions

# Create a fictional new responder

# Import a new survey dataset with 3 additional fictional 'score' columns

# Check what type of columns we have

# Take the sum of each row in the three score columns

# Find the mean and standard deviations of each score column

# Create plots of the data

# Q: How many responders said that they had no experience with R?
# What was the total score of responder 12?
# What was the max total score in the data?
# Plot a bar plot of duration for only the first 7 responders

# Part 3, using a package

# Create a 3x3x2 array from M and N
